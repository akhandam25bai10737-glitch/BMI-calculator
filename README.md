# Project Title: BMI-calculator

Overview of the Project:
This project is a simple Python BMI calculator that takes weight(kg)and height(m),validates input, calculates BMI, and provides a health classification in the console. Its primary function is to calculate a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight in kilograms and height in meters. The program validates user input, performs the mathematical calculation using the standard BMI formula, and then provides a basic classification (e.g., Underweight, Normal) for the resulting BMI score.
Features:
User Input: Prompts the user to enter their weight (kg) and height (m).Input Validation: Uses :to ensure the user enters valid numeric data and checks if the entered values are positive.BMI Classification: Provides an immediate interpretation of the result based on common BMI categories.Displays the final BMI value rounded to two decimal places for readability.
Tools used:
Text Editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, IDLE): Used to write and save the Python code.
Steps to Install & Run the Project:
Install Python ,Save the code ,open terminal ,Execute the code,Enter Data
Instructions for Testing:
Test the calculator with various inputs to ensure it handles all scenarios correctly, especially the validation and classification logic.
